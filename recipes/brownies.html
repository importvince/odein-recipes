    <p class="font-adj">Warning! These brownies are highly <em>dank</em> and may cause long naps, diet planning, and sharing with anybody who will take the leftovers.</p>
    
    <h2>Brownie Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark choc chips</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp water</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>
    </ol>
